Except for `static/chart.js`, this code is released under The Unlicense, which means you can do whatever you want with it, though I'd encourage anyone to post back improvements.

`chart.js` is released under the MIT license and I have nothing to do with, but include here for convenience.

No warranty of any kind is offered or implied. Use this code at your own risk.
